I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer.

**If you'd rather not ask your question publicly**, send me an email (address below) and I can post the question anonymously for you.

Anything means anything. Personal questions. Money. Life. Code. Whatever.

#### Guidelines

- Ensure your question hasn't already been answered.
- Use a succinct title and description.
- Bugs & feature requests should be opened on the relevant issue tracker.
- Support questions are better asked on Stack Overflow.
- Be civil and polite :)
- I will not help you with a question that goes against my personal moral standards.

*I can also be reached on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeanpaul1304) and [email](mailto:kent+ama@doddsfamily.us), but I prefer [this medium](https://github.com/jeanpaul1304/ama/issues/new). It's often the only way I can justify taking the time to answer. Read: ["Hi, thanks for reaching out to me ðŸ‘‹"](https://medium.com/@jeanpaul1304/hi-thanks-for-reaching-out-to-me-d970e7e6632).*
